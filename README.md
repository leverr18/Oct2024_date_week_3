Data Bootcamp Week Three Python
In this assignment, we demonstrated the use of python in VS code via two datasets.

The first one was centered around keeping track of profit and losses across 86 months. Reading into the csv file and looping through it to create a some kind of leaderboard, but more so a readable version of the data.

The second, we acted as someone helping a rural town modernize their vote counting process, having to sort through candidates and votes via the use of dictionaries within python. The end goal was to output the results of the election accurately.
